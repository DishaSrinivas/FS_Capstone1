            <li> <h3>EPW Replatform</h3>
                <p>A legacy database had to be migrated to an Oracle database for this project. As a
                    database developer, I was involved with the project's data, SQL, and database object
                    migration. I developed a framework in Python to automate the SQL conversion which
                    resulted in an 80% reduction in manual work. Additionally, I've worked directly with Oracle
                    GoldenGate, which we employed for data migration. Furthermore, I have firsthand
                    experience with tools like Oracle GoldenGate. For my efforts on this project, I have won
                    accolades and been appreciated by the customer.

                    I worked on the computer vision component to develop a machine learning model that can
                    recognize and classify plastic waste. During the project, I worked extensively with numerous
                    Python libraries, including Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.
